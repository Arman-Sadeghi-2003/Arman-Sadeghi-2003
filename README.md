# 👋 Hi, I'm Arman Sadeghi

I'm a passionate developer with a strong focus on .NET and cross-platform frameworks. I love exploring the depths of programming, solving complex technical problems, and creating applications that are both powerful and user-friendly. Currently, I'm exploring frameworks like Avalonia and .NET MAUI, along with advancing my knowledge in **Artificial Intelligence**.

## 👀 My Interests
- **.NET and Cross-Platform Development**: From WPF to Avalonia, I enjoy building applications that reach a wide range of platforms with clean, maintainable code.
- **UI/UX Design**: I have a keen eye for detail, working to ensure my applications are as engaging as they are functional, with smooth animations and responsive layouts.
- **Database Management and Backend Development**: Whether it’s handling database versioning or optimizing queries, I aim to design systems that balance efficiency and scalability.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: I’m keen to explore how AI can bring smarter, more adaptive features to my applications.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- **Advanced Cross-Platform Development**: Deepening my knowledge in Avalonia and .NET MAUI to create seamless, adaptable applications.
- **Async Patterns and Performance Optimization**: Exploring techniques to enhance responsiveness and efficiency across different platforms.
- **Cloud Integration and Database Scalability**: Experimenting with cloud databases and backend optimizations to bring scalability and reliability to my projects.

## 💻 What I’m Working On
- Building versatile applications that incorporate **MVVM** and **Dependency Injection** for structured and modular code.
- Enhancing a **cafe management system** to serve both customers and cafe owners with tailored features across web, desktop, and mobile applications.
- Exploring **open-source contributions** and community projects to deepen my understanding and collaborate with other developers.

## 💞️ Looking to Collaborate On
I'm always open to joining projects that push the boundaries of cross-platform development, involve innovative UI/UX design, or integrate AI for enhanced user experience. If you have ideas or projects that align with these interests, I’d love to connect!

## ⚡ Fun Fact
I’m fascinated by the potential of **AI** to transform user experiences, and I’m always exploring new ways to make technology feel intuitive and accessible. I believe in learning by doing and often dive into mini-projects just to test out new patterns or tools.
